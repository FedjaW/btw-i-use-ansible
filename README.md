# Description

This repo contains an ansible playbook for fully automated setup of a development environment.

# Prerequisites 

This ansible playbook supports `MacOSX` and `Ubunug`.

The bare minimum you need to have on your system is `sudo`, `git`, `curl`

Make sure you have the latest packages installed:

```
# MaxOSX
brew update && brew upgrade
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

# Usage

## Run *

Replace `<REPO_PATH>` with the absolut path to the desired target clone directory, e.g.: `/happypath`

```SHELL
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FedjaW/btw-i-use-ansible/main/main.sh | bash -s -- <REPO_PATH>
```

**Grab a coffee, come back and voil√†, your development environment is set up and ready to use.**

\* If you don't want the script to run immediately, then clone the repo, make changes to it as you like and then run within the repo folder:

```SHELL
./main.sh
```

## For debugging

- you need to have `docker` installed

- cd into `./debug`
- run `./build-and-run-dockers.sh`

It will automatically bring up a docker container and run the ansible playbook.
